## Defining the two AIs and the rules of the game

### Rules kept

We are keeping the rules of the first edition, with one exception : the wonder step's resources can be sold and bought.

### Safe AI

Strategy based on a **preference list**.
In ages I and II :

- a card providing 2 or more resource types is always played
- a card providing a single resource type that is lacking to the rbAI is always played
- a military card is always played if rbAI is not the only leader in military, and thecard allows rbAI to become the (or one of the) leading military player(s)
- the civil card with the greatest VP award is always played
- a science card is always played
- a random remaining card is played if possible, else a random card is discarded

In the third game age, the set of rules is superseded by choosing the decision with best immediate VP reward.

This is the rule-based AI taken from the [article](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01406496/document) *Monte-Carlo Tree Search for the Game of ‚Äù7 Wonders‚Äù* by Denis Robilliard, Cyril Fonlupt and Fabien Teytaud.

### Ambitious AI
